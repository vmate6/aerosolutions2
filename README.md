# AeroSoLutions2
Toolset for evaluating aerosol data

AeroSoLutions is a Windows application (a .NET project) to perform various evaluations on aerosol data. The first version was centered about processing cloud condensation nuclei data from a two chamber CCNc.

This version is aimed to process the Multilinear Engine 2 result files created with the positive matrix factorization script for source apportionment.

Status: in preparation.
